Background

App was created after volunteering in Barbados responding to calls from the "Turtle Hotline" about nesting and hatchling sea turtles around the island. Creating an app to report a turtle has many benefits: it creates another avenue for people to report turtles; the app collects the GPS data to pinpoint exactly where and when the event occured; it automatically inputs the report into a database and eliminates the need to do so manually; it provides easy access to information about the turtles and a way to donate to the program.
